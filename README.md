#THE CHALLENGE: DONâ€™T CRASH MY DRONE
**AERONAUTICS**

Create an app that will enable small drone operators to know more about specific weather parameters, local terrain and no fly zones within a five-mile radius of their GPS location.

**EXPLANATION**

Providing a public API for autonomous drones & small drone owners to verify if their current location & current flight path is "safe" (does not pass no-fly zone, weather conditions, planes, etc). 
For private drone owners their will be a mobile app (iOS & Android) which they can use for their pre-flight check.
